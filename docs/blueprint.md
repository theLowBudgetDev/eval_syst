- 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used to provide a clean and modern feel to the application, and good legibility.
- Use a consistent set of professional icons. Use line icons to provide a sleek and modern look. Icons should provide simple visual cues to the functions they represent, without distraction. A toggle icon to switch between dark and light mode.
- Employ a clean and structured layout. Use a grid system to maintain consistency and alignment. Prioritize a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring employees and supervisors can find and understand information effortlessly.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. Micro-interactions provide feedback without distracting. Animation use should be limited to places where there is a direct usability benefit.
